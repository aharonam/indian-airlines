        <h2>Background: Air India’s Route to Israel</h2>
        <p>Air India launched direct flights from New Delhi to Tel Aviv in 2018, becoming the first airline to fly to Israel via Saudi Arabian airspace. The route, operated using Boeing 787 Dreamliners, provided a vital connection for passengers traveling between India and Israel.</p>

        <h2>Flight Suspension Announcements</h2>
        <p>Due to the ongoing regional conflict, Air India has announced the suspension of its flights to and from Tel Aviv. This decision follows escalating tensions in the Middle East, with increased security risks in Israeli airspace.</p>
        <p>Air India stated, “In view of the ongoing situation in parts of the Middle East, we have suspended scheduled operations of our flights to and from Tel Aviv with immediate effect.”</p>
        
        <h2>Reasons for the Suspension</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> The risk of missile or drone attacks in the region has led to precautionary flight suspensions.</li>
            <li><strong>Airspace Restrictions:</strong> Warnings from aviation authorities and changes in airspace control influenced the airline’s decision.</li>
            <li><strong>Passenger and Crew Safety:</strong> Air India prioritized the well-being of its passengers and staff amid uncertain security conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Impact on Passengers</h2>
        <p>The sudden suspension has affected hundreds of travelers. Air India has assured customers that affected tickets will be eligible for full refunds or rebooking options on alternative routes.</p>
        
        <h2>Alternative Travel Options</h2>
        <p>Passengers looking to travel to Israel can explore options with airlines that continue to operate, including El Al, Emirates, and Turkish Airlines, which offer connecting flights to Tel Aviv.</p>
        
        <h2>Industry Reactions and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Aviation experts suggest that Air India’s suspension aligns with similar actions taken by other global carriers. While no timeline for resumption has been confirmed, the airline continues to monitor the situation and may reinstate flights once stability improves.</p>
        
        <h2>Expert Opinions</h2>
        <p>Analysts believe the suspension is a temporary measure rather than a permanent exit from the Israeli market. “It’s a pause for safety – not a cancellation of the relationship,” noted a civil aviation expert in New Delhi. The airline is expected to resume operations once conditions allow.</p>
        
        <h2>Government Response</h2>
        <p>Indian government officials are working closely with Air India to assess the security situation. Emergency repatriation efforts have been considered for Indian nationals in Israel.</p>
        
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>The suspension reflects broader concerns in the aviation industry regarding flights in conflict zones. Air India has assured passengers that updates will be provided as the situation develops.</p>
